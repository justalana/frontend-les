            <h2>Mercury</h2>
            <p id="p">Mercury has been known for a long time because it is visible to the naked eye. Galileo Galilei made the first telescopic observation of this small planet in the 17th century. <br>
                It was named after the swift Roman god of commerce. Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. It lies at an average distance of about 58 million kilometers. <br>
                Measuring around 4,880 km across, Mercury is the smallest of all the eight planets. It is 2.6x smaller than our planet and is just slightly bigger than the Earth’s Moon. </p>

            <h2>Venus</h2>
            <p id="p">Venus is only the second-closest planet to the Sun but it is the hottest. It has a very thick atmosphere which traps the heat from the Sun, thus causing its temperature to rise. <br>
                It got its name from the Roman goddess of love and beauty, whose Greek counterpart is Aphrodite. This planet lies around 108 million km from the Sun. It is 12,104 km across, about the same size as Earth. <br>
                Because of that, it is often called “Earth’s twin.” However, other than size, the two are very different. Venus is scorching hot, with temperatures around 475 °C. <br>
                Venus is one of the brightest objects in our night sky, second only to the Moon. It has been a common sky fixture ever since antiquity, so one is credited with its discovery. <br>
                Because it is close to the Earth, Venus appears exceptionally bright to us. Even during the day, it is bright enough to be seen.</p>

            <h2>Mars</h2>
            <p id="p">Mars is often dubbed the “Red Planet” because of the iron on its surface. It is the fourth planet from the Sun, located around 228 million km away. This is a dry desert world that is also very cold. <br>
                Mars has been known by the ancients, looking like a reddish point in the night sky. The red planet got its name from the Roman god of war whose Greek equivalent is Ares. <br>
                It has two satellites—the most moons of any terrestrial planet. Phobos and Deimos have irregular shapes. They are named after the sons of Ares (Mars) in Greek mythology.</p>
